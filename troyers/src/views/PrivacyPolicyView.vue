      <h2>How long do we retain your data?</h2>
      <p>
        If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained
        indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up
        comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
      </p>
      <p>
        For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the
        personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can
        see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they
        cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and
        edit that information.

      <h2>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h2>
      <p>

        personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third
        parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business,
        or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this
        information confidential.

        appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or

        non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other
